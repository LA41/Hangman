# Hangman
Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses, says Wikipedia. Well, in this case you can play either with a computer or a friend, and there's only one word to guess. Your job is to make it in six steps (since there are six parts of man to be hanged). If your letter-guess is right, the letter will appear in the occupied location. If you're wrong, another body part of hangman will be prompted on the screen.

My main motivation in here is building up my portfolio and skillset. With this project I learnt how to create list and load dictionary file.
